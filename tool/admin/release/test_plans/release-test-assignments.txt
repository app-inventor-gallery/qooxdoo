//THIS IS A TEMPLATE - ADAPT TO NEED


Hi,

here are the proposed test assignments.

The basic idea is that everybody does a full and mini application test.

Mini application tests focus on visual aspects (showcase, widget browser). Overall they should be a lot less time-consuming than full tests. Details about the mini tests will be noted on the test sheets.

DW
  uses "W8" (1.1.1.1) and own Linux
  Full application tests: IE8 (XP)
  Mini application tests: Opera 11.10 (Linux) 
  Toolchain tests: Cygwin (verify with IE) and contributions

TK
  uses own Mac and "W7" (1.1.1.1)
  Full application tests: Chrome Stable (Mac)
  Mini application tests: FF 3.6 (XP)
  Toolchain tests: Mac (verify with Chrome)

MW
  uses own Mac
  Full application tests: Opera 11.52 (OSX)
  Mini application tests: FF 4 (OSX)
  Toolchain tests: Mac (verify with Opera)

TB
  uses own Mac and "W6" (1.1.1.1)
  Full application tests: Safari 5.1.1 (OSX)
  Mini application tests: IE 6
  Toolchain tests: XP (verify with IE)

CH
  uses own Windows
  Full application tests: IE 9 (Win 7)
  Mini application tests: /
  Toolchain tests: Win7 (verify with IE)

AS
  uses own Windows (Laptop)

  Mini application tests: IE 10 Platform Preview (Win 7)
  Toolchain tests: Win7 (verify with IE 10)

TH
